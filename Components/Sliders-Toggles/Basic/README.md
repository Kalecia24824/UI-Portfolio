<em>by Kalecia McNeal</em>

## 🎯 Objective

The main goal of this project is to showcase how versatile a simple slider can be in many ways  

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech
- HTML

## 📌 Outcome
With the project all finished, here are the final results: 
- A light overall background with a dark container 
- The heading's color is the color of the moon which is a pale yellow
- A slider with the thumb as the image of the moon 
- Lastly but not least, the background of the slider changes into a nighttime gradient as the user drags it across the screen

## 🔍 Reflection
Overall, I enjoyed this project! I will admit some parts of the project were not easy. For example, changing the image of the thumb to the moon icon was a little difficult. Another issue was matching the linear-gradient in the function to the style I made in CSS. Once I was able to figure how those parts work by testing them I was able to complete the project!
