# 🌱 Basics Project Folder 
<em>by Kalecia McNeal</em>

## 📖 Summary:
Welcome to the Basics project folder where you can find all of my projects that deal with the fundamentals in JavaScript such as functions, loops, control statements. 

## 🛠 Skills in this folder:
- Learning how to use the `console.log` to print to the screen

- Establishing variables with their data type values 

- Building reusable coding blocks in JS by creating functions

- Controlling where data goes using control statements such as `if-else`, `loops`, and `switches`

- Organizing and storing data in JS by using arrays and their methods along with objects 

## 📂 Sub-Directory:
Here are the following projects that make up the Basics folder 

### 🌍 Hello World: 
This is the first project that prints to the screen using `console.log`. 

Link: [Hello README](./Hello-World/README.md "My Hello World README")

### 🧪 Variables: 
The project deals with defining variables and data type values using keywords such as let or const. 

Link: [Variables README](./Variables/README.md "My Variables README")

### ➕ Functions: 
This project teaches you about functions by learning how to create one and understanding the difference between an expression and declarations 

Link: [Functions README](./Functions/README.md "My Functions README")

### 📃 Arrays:
This project teaches you how to create an array, manipulate them using methods such as pop and how to loop through them using keywords such as for. 

Link: [Arrays README](./Arrays/README.md "My Arrays README")

### 🔵 Objects: 
The Objects project is designed to help learn about objects are created with properties, how to access them through dot and bracket notation, and how to add/update properties. 

Link: [Objects README](./Objects/README.md "My Objects README")

### 🛤️ Control Statements: 
Learn how to control where data goes through using statements such as `if-else`, `switch` and through loops such as `for` or `while`. 

Link: [Control Statements README](./Control-Statements/README.md "My Control Statements README")
