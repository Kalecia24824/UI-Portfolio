# 🧪 Variables Project README 
<em>by Kalecia McNeal</em>

## 📖 Summary:
Welcome to the Variables README where you can find more information about the project including the goal, skills used, the process and some acknowledgements

## ✨ Goal:
Declare some variables using the keywords `let` and `const`. Then make sure there are variables for each data type in JS

## 🛠 Skills: 
Here are the following skills used in the project: 
- Using keywords let and const to initialize a variable 

- Naming variables using identifiers that follow with JavaScript's rules for naming 

- Utilizing each data type to assign a variable's value to it 

## Process: 
**Beginning**: I started this program by creating a new file called script.js. 

**Middle**: Then I started naming variables and assigning values to them based on the data type.  

**End**: Finally, I ran the program with no issues and took a screenshot to showcase that the program works. 

## 📸 Final Screenshot:
Here is the final screenshot I took of the project:

## What I would have changed: 
After making this, I would not change anything
