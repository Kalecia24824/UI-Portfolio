//Today, we are going to assign some variables! 
//Each variable will be assigned to a value that is a part of the eight data types of JavaScript

//These variables can be declared using let or const. Let is can be used if you want to change the variables value while const is only used one. Here we go! 

let myAge = 23; //Number

let message = "Have a great day!"; //String

let isNight = false; //Boolean 

const apple = {
  color: "red", 
  size: "medium-round", 
  quantity: 1, 
  isSweet: "Can be",
}; //Object

const timesDay = ["dawn", "morning", "afternoon", "evening", "night"]; //Array

let uname; //Undefined

const ball = null; //Null

const mySymbol = Symbol(); 

console.log(myAge);
console.log(message);
console.log(isNight);
console.log(apple);
console.log(timesDay);
console.log(uname);
console.log(ball);
console.log(mySymbol);

//That's it for all the variable types!
