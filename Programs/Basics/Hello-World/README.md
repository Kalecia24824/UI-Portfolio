## 📖 Summary:
Welcome to the Hello World README where you can find more information about the project including the goal, skills used, the process and some acknowledgements

## ✨ Goal: 
Create the traditional program all developers make for the first time 

## 🛠 Skills: 
Here are the following skills used in the project 
- Using `console.log` to print to the screen 

## Process: 
**Beginning**: I started this program by creating a new file called script.js. 

**Middle**: Then, I typed the command console.log which lets you print to the screen. 

**End**: Lastly, I typed the string "Hello, World" inside the parenthesis then printed it to the terminal.
