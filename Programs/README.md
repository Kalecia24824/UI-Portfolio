## 📖 Summary: 
Welcome to the Programs folder! Here you can find all of my projects based on **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Each project in this folder will be similar to the Design folder except it will be interactive.  

## 🛠 Skills in this folder:
- Reading and validating user input before submission
- Writing reusable code blocks with function and arrow functions
- Selecting and updating elements with document.querySelector & document.getElementById
- Storing and retrieving data with key-value pairs using Objects 

## 📂 Sub-Directory: 
Each folder in this main directory will contain its own README along with along with the corresponding projects based on a topic:

The Basics folder will contain all basic JS programs that can run on the console such as variables, functions, arrays, control statements and fundamental things needed.
