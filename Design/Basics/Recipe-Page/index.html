        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>These are the ingredients you will need:</p>
        <ul> <h3>The Cake</h3>
          <li>2 cups of flour</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon of baking powder</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
          <li>1/4 cup of coconut oil</li>
          <li>3/4 cup of coconut milk (no canned, just drinking)</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons of honey</li>
          <li>1 quart of strawberries</li>
        </ul>

        <ul> <h3>Coconut Whipped Cream</h3>
          <li>1 can (14 oz) of full-fat coconut cream. <br>
          Must be refrigerated for 24 hours with the excess liquid drained after the deadline.</li>
          <li>3 tablespoons of maple sugar</li>
          <li>1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
          <li>Alternative to the extract: 1/4 of vanilla bean powder</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div> <!--Instructions-->
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees</li>
          <li>Chill the bowl of your mixer or food processor</li>
          <li>In a large mixing bowl: mix flour, baking powder and salt together to form self-rising flour</li>
          <li>Mix the flour and coconut oil together with a whisk, form or pastry blender until the mixture resembles course crumbs</li>
          <li>Add honey and coconut milk to the dough</li>
          <li>Then stir everything together until it is all combined</li>
          <li>Knead the dough a few times (be sure to not-overwork it)</li>
          <li>Turn the dough out on a flour surface and press it with your hands until it is 3/4 in thickness</li>
          <li>Cut the dough into circles using a biscuit or cookie cutter or anything round with a rim</li>
          <li>Transfer the biscuits to a parchment paper lined sheet</li>
          <li>Brush all the biscuits with coconut milk</li>
          <li>Bake 8 to 11 minutes on the center rack until the biscuits are lightly brown on top. Watch them carefully as the honey can burn easily</li>
          <li>While the shortcakes are baking, make the whipped cream: pour the excess liquid from the coconut cream and dump the remaining into a bowl of a food processor or mixer. Add sugar and vanilla before whipping the cream until peaks form or close to it.</li>
          <li>Cook the shortcakes for 5 mins</li>
          <li>Cut the shortcakes and slice the strawberries in half before adding them together with the whipped cream in the middle!</li>
        </ol>
